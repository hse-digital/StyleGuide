Behold the Health and Safety Executive's Design Pattern Library!

This library exists to ensure consistency across the HSE's digital platforms and to do away with unnecessary code re-use.

To use this library please follow the steps below:

1) Consult the Health and Safety Style Guide (available here INSERT LINK HERE) to identify the styles that you will need to fit your development needs.

2) Clone or Download this repository to your local machine.

3) Clone or Download the dp-css-alpha-library repository and use it to fill the content of the Content folder.

Now go back to the Style Guide from step 1 and copy and paste the styles that you would like to use, into your project!
